A PHP mobile/desktop User-Agent parser, with support for Laravel, based on [`jenssegers/agent`](https://github.com/jenssegers/agent) which based on the [Mobile Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect).

## Installation

```sh
$ composer require elfsundae/agent
```

## Laravel (Optional)

If your application runs on Lumen, or on earlier Laravel than v5.5 which does not support [package discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/packages#package-discovery), you need to register the service provider manually:

```php
ElfSundae\Agent\AgentServiceProvider::class,
```

And add the `Agent` facade alias:

```php
'Agent' => ElfSundae\Agent\Facades\Agent::class,
```
